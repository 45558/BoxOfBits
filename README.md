Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
BoxOfBits FAQ:

	What are the benefits of using BoxOfBits?
	-----------------------------------------
    Since BoxOfBits is a plugin designed to have a massive amount of functionality, it means that instead of searching for all those little features in different plugins and getting more than your server can handle, you can just download and use the many features of BoxOfBits!

    What compatability does BoxOfBits have?
    ---------------------------------------
    BoxOfBits is designed to be used with PocketMine-MP, and as it has only been tested with PM-MP although it may work with others like Genysis, don't be surprised if you find bugs! Also, we cannot assure you that BoxOfBits will be compatible will all other plugins, so if you find that a plugin is causing errors with BoxOfBits, please ask the plugin developer to add BoxOfBits compatability. All the same, please report all bugs to us and we will do our best to resolve them.

    Why does it usually take so long to update BoxOfBits?
    ---------------------------------------------
    One of the main reasons it takes so long to update is simply that many of the main developers working on this project have other projects, school, and many other things going on in their lives, leaving them without much time to concentrate on BoxOfBits. Even then, after the developers have done their job and the update is finished it still requires endless beta-testing, bug-fixing, and going over the code trying to fix and clean up any little mistakes to keep the code as clean as possible. Still, because of all this you can be assured that when the update finally comes out it will be just as good as you wish it could be!

    Can I contribute to BoxOfBits?
    ------------------------------
    Of course you can contribute to BoxOfBits! Their are a few major things you can contribute to, like developing and beta-testing. But if you don't think you are able to help with that and still want to contribute to BoxOfBits their are others you can help with, like helping setup documentations, showcasing the plugin so other people can find it as well, or just requesting some of your favourite features to be added in when we run out of ideas!

    Does BoxOfBits have an API that I can use?
    ------------------------------------------
    A new feature in the 1.0.0 update, you can access almost any feature BoxOfBits has to offer through our extensive API! Plugin developers out in the wide world of code suddenly have a much wider range of acessible features. For a full API documentation, please read the wiki or check out the API section of this file below.
